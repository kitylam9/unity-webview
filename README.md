# unity-webview

unity-webview is a plugin for Unity 5 that overlays WebView components
on Unity view. It works on Android, iOS, Unity Web Player, and Mac
(Windows is not supported for now).

unity-webview is derived from keijiro-san's
https://github.com/keijiro/unity-webview-integration .

## Sample Project

It is placed under `sample/`. You can open it and import the plugin as
below:

1. Open `sample/Assets/Sample.unity`.
2. Open `dist/unity-webview.unitypackage` and import all files. It
   might be easier to extract `dist/unity-webview.zip` instead if
   you've imported unity-webview before.

## Platform Specific Notes

### Mac (Editor)

#### Auto Graphics API/Metal Editor Support

The current implementation reiles on several OpenGL APIs so you need to disable "Auto graphics API"
and specify OpenGLCore as below.

If you work only in (recent) Unity Editor, you may just disable "Metal Editor Support" (cf. https://github.com/gree/unity-webview/issues/383 ).

#### App Transport Security

Since Unity 5.3.0, Unity.app is built with ATS (App Transport
Security) enabled and non-secured connection (HTTP) is not
permitted. If you want to open `http://foo/bar.html` with this plugin
on Unity Mac Editor, you need to open
`/Applications/Unity5.3.4p3/Unity.app/Contents/Info.plist` with a text
editor and add the following,

```diff

#### WebViewSeparated.bundle

WebViewSeparated.bundle is a variation of WebView.bundle. It is based
on https://github.com/gree/unity-webview/pull/161 . As noted in the
pull-request, it shows a separate window and allows a developer to
utilize the Safari debugger. For enabling it, please define
`WEBVIEW_SEPARATED`.

### iOS

The implementation now supports WKWebView but it is disabled by
default. For enabling it, please set enableWKWebView as below:

```csharp
        webViewObject = (new GameObject("WebViewObject")).AddComponent<WebViewObject>();
        webViewObject.Init(
            ...
            enableWKWebView: true);
```
(cf. https://github.com/gree/unity-webview/blob/de9a25c0ab0622b15c15ecbc0c7cd85858aa7745/sample/Assets/Scripts/SampleWebView.cs#L94)

Please also note that this flag have no effect on platforms without WKWebView (such as iOS7 and
Android).

### Android

#### hardwareAccelerated

The main activity should have `android:hardwareAccelerated="true"`, otherwise a webview won't run
smoothly. Depending on unity versions, we need to set it as below (basically this will be done by
post-process build scripts).

##### Unity 2018.1 or newer

Based on the technique discussed in
https://forum.unity.com/threads/android-hardwareaccelerated-is-forced-false-in-all-activities.532786/ and https://github.com/Over17/UnityAndroidManifestCallback, `Assets/Plugins/Editor/UnityWebViewPostprocessBuild.cs` edit the manifest to set `android:hardwareAccelerated="true"`. Please note this works with the `gradle` (not `internal`) build setting.

##### Unity 2017.x - 2018.0

Unity forcibly set `android:hardwareAccelerated="false"` regardless of its setting in `Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml`, as discussed in https://github.com/gree/unity-webview/issues/382 (see also https://github.com/gree/unity-webview/issues/342 and https://forum.unity.com/threads/android-hardwareaccelerated-is-forced-false-in-all-activities.532786/ ), and there is no solution for automatically correcting this setting. Please export the project and manually correct AndroidManifest.xml.

##### Unity 5.x or older

After the initial build, `Assets/Plugins/Editor/UnityWebViewPostprocessBuild.cs` will copy
`sample/Temp/StatingArea/AndroidManifest-main.xml` to
`sample/Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml`, edit the latter to add
`android:hardwareAccelerated="true"` to `<activity
android:name="com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity" ...`. Then you need to build the app again to
reflect this change.

*NOTE: Unity 5.6.1p4 or newer (including 2017 1.0) seems to fix the following issue. cf. https://github.com/gree/unity-webview/pull/212#issuecomment-314952793*

For Unity 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 (except 5.6.1p4), you also need to modify `android:name` from
`com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity` to
`net.gree.unitywebview.CUnityPlayerActivity`. This custom activity
implementation will adjust Unity's SurfaceView z order. Please refer
`plugins/Android/src/net/gree/unitywebview/CUnityPlayerActivity.java`
and `plugins/Android/src/net/gree/unitywebview/CUnityPlayer.java` if
you already have your own activity implementation.

#### How to build WebViewPlugin.jar

The following steps are for Mac but you can follow similar ones for Windows.

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).
2. Open Android Studio and select "Configure/SDK Manager", select the followings with "Show Package Details",
   and click OK.
  * SDK Platforms
    * Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)
      * Android SDK Platform 23
  * SDK Tools
    * Android SDK Build Tools
      * 28.0.2
3. Open Terminal.app and perform the followings. You should find
   `unity-webview/build/Packager/Assets/Plugins/Android/WebViewPlugin.jar` if successful.

```bash
$ export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/bin:~/Library/Android/sdk/tools:~/Library/Android/sdk/tools/bin
$ cd unity-webview/plugins/Android
$ ./install.sh
```

### Web Player

The implementation utilizes IFRAME so please put both
"an\_unityplayer\_page.html" and "a\_page\_loaded\_in\_webview.html"
should be placed on the same domain for avoiding cross-domain
requests.
